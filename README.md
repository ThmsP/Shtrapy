# STRAPY :warning: *Wildly unstable* :construction:

For cycling geek and self privacy lovers. This project is less usefull than the original -by far- but it should be useful to monitor the gpx tracks and stats of a few cyclists (there is no authentification). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. --In construction--

### Prerequisites

Strapy is based on the following libraries : 

Python :

```

gpxpy : https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy
mplleaflet : https://github.com/jwass/mplleaflet
pandas : https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas
matplotlib : https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
pygal (for now) : https://github.com/Kozea/pygal

```

Html/CSS :

```
skeleton : https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton

```

### Installing

Install the prerequisites. (pip install for all ...). You don't need Skeleton, a version is included in the repo.  

Download this repo : 

```
git clone https://github.com/ThmsP/strapy.git
```
